The goal of this project is to provide an interesting way to work with polynomials in Python. I'm not sure if anyone's done this before,
or even if it has any particular use-case, but I just learned about classes and objects as a computer science major, and I thought this sounded fun.
I am trying to add as many features as I can think of, including doing operations between polynomials, differentiating and integrating them, evaluating them at points, etc.
This is mostly for fun, but if someone can find a use for it then I'd be very excited!
